    "# Analysis 01: NemaScan Pipeline Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes how the GWAS mapping results in `data/processed/20231116_Analysis_NemaScan/` were generated using the NemaScan pipeline. **These results are provided pre-computed and will be automatically decompressed during the analysis workflow. You do not need to re-run this pipeline unless you want to modify mapping parameters or use different input data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Information\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Pipeline**: [andersenlab/nemascan](https://github.com/andersenlab/nemascan)\n",
    "-   **Commit hash**: `b58711369124885fb90ce9c53b720313fa68f79b`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline requires trait data generated by `analysis/trait_generate_mapping_inputs.qmd`, which processes raw phenotype data into the format required by NemaScan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Command Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline was executed on an HPC cluster with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan \\\n",
    "  -profile mappings \\\n",
    "  -r b58711369124885fb90ce9c53b720313fa68f79b \\\n",
    "  --vcf 20220216 \\\n",
    "  --traitfile /projects/b1059/projects/Tim/2021_GWA_manuscript/data/raw/traitfiles/toxicant.traits.tsv \\\n",
    "  --sthresh EIGEN \\\n",
    "  --group_qtl 200 \\\n",
    "  --ci_size 50 \\\n",
    "  --finemap TRUE \\\n",
    "  --mediation TRUE \\\n",
    "  --out /projects/b1059/projects/Tim/2021_GWA_manuscript/data/processed/20231116_Analysis_NemaScan\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Re-running the Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to re-run the mapping analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clone the NemaScan repository at the specific commit\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/andersenlab/nemascan.git\n",
    "cd nemascan\n",
    "git checkout b58711369124885fb90ce9c53b720313fa68f79b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prepare input data\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Run `analysis/trait_generate_mapping_inputs.qmd` to generate trait files\n",
    "-   Ensure you have access to the WI VCF version 20220216, which can be downloaded from [CaeNDR](https://caendr.org/data/data-release)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Run the pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "nextflow run main.nf \\\n",
    "  -profile mappings \\\n",
    "  --vcf 20220216 \\\n",
    "  --traitfile <path_to_trait_file> \\\n",
    "  --sthresh EIGEN \\\n",
    "  --group_qtl 200 \\\n",
    "  --ci_size 50 \\\n",
    "  --finemap TRUE \\\n",
    "  --mediation TRUE \\\n",
    "  --out <output_directory>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Replace the archived results\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Compress the output directory using tar with xz compression (more efficient than gzip):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    tar -cJf 20231116_Analysis_NemaScan.tar.xz 20231116_Analysis_NemaScan/\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Replace `data/raw/nemascan_output/20231116_Analysis_NemaScan.tar.xz` with your new archive"
